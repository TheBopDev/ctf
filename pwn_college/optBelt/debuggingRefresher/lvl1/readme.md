This challenge makes us get familiar with running GDB. It is very simple.

All we have to do is run the challenge
    /challenge/embryogdb_level1

It will automatically start the program with GDB and pause at a breakpoint.

You can start the program by typing 's' or 'start', which will run to the next breakpoint.

From there, you must type 'c' or 'continue'. Doing so will print the flag.
