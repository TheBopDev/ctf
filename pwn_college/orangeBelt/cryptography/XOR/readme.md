# pwn.college writeup XOR

In the terminal, type
    /challenge/run

The challenge program will run, giving you a random key and random encrypted secret.

You must XOR the two together. I've created a python script to do this.
Just edit the numbers in the xor.py file with the numbers shown on your screen, save the file and type
    python xor.py

The XOR value will be printed to the terminal. Use that value and give it to the program.
